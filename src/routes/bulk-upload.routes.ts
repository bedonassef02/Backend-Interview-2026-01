/**
 * BULK UPLOAD FEATURE — PLACEHOLDER
 *
 * TASK:
 * 1. Implement bulk upload of records via CSV using the model in:
 *    src/models/bulk-upload-record.model.ts (BulkUploadRecord).
 *
 * 2. Use the temp DB at data/bulk-upload-temp.json to persist records
 *    during upload/processing (read/write the JSON file accordingly).
 *
 * 3. Include a simple authentication form (e.g. API key, token, or basic
 *    credentials) before accepting uploads, to prevent system abuse.
 *
 * Do not add the actual CSV parsing or service implementation in this
 * file yet — only the model and temp DB are provided for now.
